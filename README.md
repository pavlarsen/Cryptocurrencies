# Cryptocurrencies


The purpose of this project is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the new crypto investment. The original data had to be processed to fit into a machine learning model based on unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we used a clustering algorithm.
